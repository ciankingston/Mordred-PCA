# Mordred-PCA
(1) 2D and 3D mordred descriptors are calculated from SMILES strings (2) Principal component analysis is used to reduce dimensions (3) The first two PCs are plotted to visualize the chemical space

SMILES are normally downloaded from Reaxys after a substructure search. The SMILES strings will be imported from an excel file (named 'smiles') in the same folder as the script.
